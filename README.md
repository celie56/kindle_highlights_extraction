# Kindle Highlights Extractor

Given a location of a Kindle Highlights file ('MyClippings.txt')
this will open up that file and extract the data into a more usable fashion.

I copied an example clippings file into ExampleClippings.txt which is
where `settings.json` currently points to.

You may run this code with:
```bash
$ python main.py
```

If you want to run against your own clippings, update the settings.json
file to point to your file.
